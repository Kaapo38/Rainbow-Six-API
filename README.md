Rainbow Six api for getting player statistics.

# Important
Ubisoft's website is structured in a way where you must be logged in before you can get player statistics. Therefore, you
must make an account with Ubisoft(assuming you don't already have one) and provide a VALID username and password. Don't worry, I didn't add any sketchy code.
This is a pretty early version, so honestly just critique the hell out of this if you find any bugs. Here's my email if you have any questions/bugs/whatever: vince1444dev@gmail.com
